Welcome to scpi-pkg's documentation!
====================================
The scpi package provides Python, R, and Stata implementations of estimation and inference procedures
for synthetic control methods using least squares, lasso, ridge, or simplex-type constraints as developed
in `Cattaneo, Feng, and Titiunik (2021) <https://cattaneo.princeton.edu/papers/Cattaneo-Feng-Titiunik_2021_JASA.pdf>`_.

Companion `R <www.r-project.org>`_ and `Stata <https://www.python.org/>`_ packages are described in 
`Cattaneo, Feng, Palomba, and Titiunik (2022) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05984>`_.

Related Stata, R, and Python packages useful for inference in synthetic control methods are described 
in the following website:

`https://nppackages.github.io/scpi/ <https://nppackages.github.io/scpi/>`_

For an introduction to synthetic control methods, see `Abadie (2021) <https://economics.mit.edu/files/17847>`_ and 
references therein.
